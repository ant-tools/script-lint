j(s)-script strict version

- all instance fields are declared into constructor
this way compiler can generate error if assign to not declared field, anywhere in class body

- class fields are not initialized with results from new operator or static method invocation
in order to avoid executing code in global scope

- do not extend native or built-in object like
$extends(comp.prj.Class, Object);
